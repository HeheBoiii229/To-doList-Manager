# To-doList-Manager
The To-Do List Manager project successfully develops a full-stack web application designed to improve user productivity and time management. The core innovation lies in integrating a rule-based AI Prioritization engine, which analyzes task title, due date, and time estimate to recommend a priority level (High, Medium, or Low).
